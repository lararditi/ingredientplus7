    <p>Sorry for calling it cliche as it is totally valid as I also identify with this phrase but we all know the phrase cooking is my love language, or a way to someone's heart passing through their stomach ONE MORE. So yeah the concept of cooking being a language is nothing new. However when it comes to recipes, things start looking a bit different. Food becomes more of a mathematical equation than a heartfelt action. Recipe testing, for example, resembles lab work more than cooking in my kitchen with its frustrating electric stove.
      
        For anyone who is not familiar with poetry, this dichotomy between the heartfelt place cooking comes from and the rigid formulated nature of recipe writing have something in common.
        
        Poetry obviously deals with words as its matter, first by thinking using them and then by exploring their "compositional possibilities" in order to reach "ranges of ranges of content/expression/meaning can be reached." (13, Brenstein). Explain more
        
        Cooking is kind of the same. Especially if you think of it on the page. Imagine just the list of ingredients without headers, titles, and instructions (which is essentially all you need when you trust your intuition for seasoning, timing, etc.): A recipe, the verbal representation of cooking, is just an ordered list of words chosen from a wide range to express an ideation. One that hopefully tastes good but doesn't always do so. 
        
        When given a sequence of a collection of words defined as VERBS, NOUNS, ADJECTIVES and PREPOSITIONS, it becomes possible to convey meaning whether it is good or bad, it doesn't become meaningless as we magical creatures are able to find meaning in what sometimes we call nonsense. 
        
        The so-called constants of language—VERBS, NOUNS, ADJECTIVES and PREPOSITIONS—when translated into cooking, required significant contemplation before I reached a conclusion. The elements range from location to climate, and as one starts thinking about these concepts, they appear to be intertwined with one another.

        for instance, which relates to terroir, which relates to anything from soil composition affecting nutrition density to topography affecting water distribution, it becomes difficult to clearly draw a line between them. This has led <LOCATION> to become not a component of the project but what it aims to reveal.
